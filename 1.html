<h2>HTML 좋은 세상이군!</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" title="MDN web docs" >HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</a> is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).
"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video> and many others.
Tags in HTML are case insensitive. That is, they can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. Example <title> tag can be written as <Title>,<TITLE> or in any other way.
